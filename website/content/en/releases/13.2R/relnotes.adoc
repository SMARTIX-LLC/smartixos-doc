== Abstract

[.abstract-title]
The release notes for FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} contain a summary of the changes made to the FreeBSD base system on the {releaseBranch} development line. This document lists applicable security advisories that were issued since the last release, as well as significant changes to the FreeBSD kernel and userland. Some brief remarks on upgrading are also presented.

[[intro]]
== Introduction

This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD {releaseCurrent}. It describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD. It also provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

The {releaseType} distribution to which these release notes apply represents the latest point along the {releaseBranch} development branch since {releaseBranch} was created. Information regarding pre-built, binary {releaseType} distributions along this branch can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/[https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/].

The {releaseType} distribution to which these release notes apply represents a point along the {releaseBranch} development branch between {releasePrev} and the future {releaseNext}. Information regarding pre-built, binary {releaseType} distributions along this branch can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/[https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/].

This distribution of FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} is a {releaseType} distribution. It can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/[https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/] or any of its mirrors. More information on obtaining this (or other) {releaseType} distributions of FreeBSD can be found in the link:{handbook}/mirrors[Obtaining FreeBSD appendix] to the link:{handbook}/[FreeBSD Handbook].

All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing FreeBSD. The errata document is updated with "late-breaking" information discovered late in the release cycle or after the release. Typically, it contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to documentation. An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

This document describes the most user-visible new or changed features in FreeBSD since {releasePrev}. In general, changes described here are unique to the {releaseBranch} branch unless specifically marked as MERGED features.

Typical release note items document recent security advisories issued after {releasePrev}, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades. They may also list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering practices. Clearly the release notes cannot list every single change made to FreeBSD between releases; this document focuses primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural improvements.

[[upgrade]]
== Upgrading from Previous Releases of FreeBSD

Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the various security branches) are supported using the man:freebsd-update[8] utility. The binary upgrade procedure will update unmodified userland utilities, as well as unmodified GENERIC kernels distributed as a part of an official FreeBSD release. The man:freebsd-update[8] utility requires that the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base system from source code) from previous versions are supported, according to the instructions in [.filename]#/usr/src/UPDATING#.

Users of all powerpc architectures, after successful kernel and world installation, will need to run manually "kldxref /boot/kernel".

[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrading FreeBSD should only be attempted after backing up _all_ data and configuration files.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
After upgrading, sshd (from OpenSSH 8.8p1) will not accept new connections until it is restarted.
After installing the new userland, either reboot (as specified in the source update procedure), or execute `service sshd restart`.

[[userland]]
== Userland

This section covers changes and additions to userland applications, contributed software, and system utilities.

[[userland-config]]
=== Userland Configuration Changes

// SAMPLE ENTRY:
// A new man:rc.conf[5] variable has been added, `linux_mounts_enable`, which controls if Linux(R)-specific filesystems are mounted in [.filename]#/compat/linux# if `linux_enable` is set to `YES`. {{< revision "364883" >}} (Sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation)

A new man:rc.conf[5] variable has been added, `growfs_swap_size`, which controls
the size of the swap partition created by the `growfs` startup script as documented
in man:growfs[7].

A new RC script, `zpoolreguid` has been added, which will assign a new GUID to
one or more zpools, useful for virtualization environments when sharing datasets.

A new RC script, `machine_id` has been added, which will generate the `/etc/machine-id`
file if it does not exist. The file is used by some libraries like GLib.
gitref:17333d92643d[repository=src]

It is now possible to add default routes for other FIBs by using the `defaultrouter_fibN`
and `ipv6_defaultrouter_fibN` man:rc.conf[5] variables.

[[userland-programs]]
=== Userland Application Changes

The man:bhyve[8] utility has gained a virtio-input device emulation support.
This will be used to inject keyboard/mouse input events into a guest.
The command line syntax is: `-s <slot>,virtio-input,/dev/input/eventX`
gitref:6192776124c5[repository=src]

The man:kdump[1] utility has gained support for decoding Linux system calls.

The man:killall[1] utility now allows sending signals to processes with
their control terminal on pts(4).
gitref:a76fa7bb6cb7[repository=src]

The man:timeout[1] utility has been moved from /usr/bin to /bin.

The man:pciconf[8] utility added support for decoding ACS extended capability.

The man:procstat[1] utility can now print information about advisory locks on
files with the newly added `advlock` command.
gitref:f9daaf452a8a[repository=src]

The man:pwd_mkdb[8] utility no longer copies comments from `/etc/master.passwd`
to `/etc/passwd`.
gitref:3e955733117d[repository=src]

MSS clamping has been improved for man:ppp[8].
gitref:301bff9bdd62[repository=src]

Metric aliasing has been changed in man:prometheus_sysctl_exporter[8] to avoid
confusing Prometheus server due to conflicting metric names.
The `tcp_log_bucket` UMA zone has been renamed to `tcp_log_id_bucket`,
and `tcp_log_node` was renamed to `tcp_log_id_node` for consistency.
Sysctl variables with `(LEGACY)` in their descriptions are no longer being
exported, these are used by ZFS sysctls that have been replaced by others,
many of which alias to the same Prometheus metric name (like `vfs.zfs.arc_max`
and `vfs.zfs.arc.max`).

[[future-releases]]
== General Notes Regarding Future FreeBSD Releases

`OPIE` has been deprecated and will be removed in FreeBSD 14.0.

The man:ce[4] and man:cp[4] synchronous serial drivers have been deprecated and will be
removed in FreeBSD 14.0.

The man:minigzip[1] utility has been deprecated and will be removed in FreeBSD 14.0.

[[future-releases-cputype]]
=== Default `CPUTYPE` Change

Starting with FreeBSD-13.0, the default `CPUTYPE` for the i386 architecture will change from `486` to `686`.

This means that, by default, binaries produced will require a 686-class CPU, including but not limited to binaries provided by the FreeBSD Release Engineering team. FreeBSD 13.0 will continue to support older CPUs, however users needing this functionality will need to build their own releases for official support.

As the primary use for i486 and i586 CPUs is generally in the embedded market, the general end-user impact is expected to be minimal, as new hardware with these CPU types has long faded, and much of the deployed base of such systems is nearing retirement age, statistically.

There were several factors taken into account for this change. For example, i486 does not have 64-bit atomics, and while they can be emulated in the kernel, they cannot be emulated in the userland. Additionally, the 32-bit amd64 libraries have been i686 since their inception.

As the majority of 32-bit testing is done by developers using the lib32 libraries on 64-bit hardware with the `COMPAT_FREEBSD32` option in the kernel, this change ensures better coverage and user experience. This also aligns with what the majority of Linux(R) distributions have been doing for quite some time.

This is expected to be the final bump of the default `CPUTYPE` in i386.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This change does not affect the FreeBSD 12.x series of releases.
